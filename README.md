BepInEx4RW Mod manager

Currently an early build, bound to have some bugs and jank because thalber's no good coder by any means.

Any and all assistance in troubleshooting is appreciated.


**HOW TO INSTALL:**

Download release, unpack somewhere.

**HOW TO USE:**

Press "Select path", navigate to Rain World's root folder, press Apply. Remembers where you left off and automatically loads stuff on the next launch. Press Reload mod list to (boom) reload mod list in case you dropped something into the Mods folder and want it to show up.
